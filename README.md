This is a quick readme of the ETL project. 
The ETL project was pivitol in our understanding of the ETL proccess. The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is a fundamental component of data integration and data warehousing. It involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it to meet specific requirements, and loading it into a target system or data warehouse. ETL enables organizations to consolidate and integrate data from multiple sources into a unified and consistent format. The extraction phase involves gathering data from different systems or databases. The transformation phase includes cleaning, validating, and restructuring the data to ensure its quality and compatibility. Finally, the loaded data is stored in a central repository for analysis and reporting purposes. ETL plays a crucial role in enabling businesses to make informed decisions based on reliable and consolidated data.

This project wasn't too bad. Some of the transforming was tricky especially with some of the included mistakes within the starter code which made certain aspects difficult to access. In the end we were able to transform all the data and then load it into postgres. Importing all the tables was a breezee and should be perfect as seen with the images.
